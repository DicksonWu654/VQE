# Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)

Hi There! ðŸ‘‹<br/>
This is a repo where you have access to my Jupiter Notebook, along with some resources that made it all possible!<br/>

## What are VQEs?

VQEs are Variational Quatnum Eigensolvers - basically a quatnum-classical algorithm that continues to guestimate (to a better and better accuracy) the minimum eigensolver for a Hamiltonian (Basically a matrix). That might seem useless right? What's the point? If you're able to represent something with a Hamiltonian, and finding the minimum eigenvector means something, then we're good! And there's actually many applications that fit the bill, for example simulating molecules!

Here, we're finding the ground state of the molecule (the natural or real state of the molecule). Ground state means lowest energy. As it turns out, we can turn the molecule into a Hamiltonian, and finding the lowest eigenvector actually means the lowest energy state of the molecule - Bingo!
